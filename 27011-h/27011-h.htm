<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>PETER BRETT.</h3>

  <p>Your correspondent T. K. seems to think that Scotchmen, and Scotch
  subjects, have an undue prominence in "N. &amp; Q.:" let me therefore
  introduce to your readers a neglected <i>Irishman</i>, in the person of
  Peter Brett, the "parish clerk and schoolmaster of Castle-Knock." This
  worthy seems to have been a great author, and the literary oracle of the
  district over which he presided, and exercised the above-named important
  functions. His <i>magnum opus</i> appears to have been his
  <i>Miscellany</i>; a farrago of prose and verse, which, to distinguish it
  from the herd of books bearing that title, is yclept, <i>par
  excellence</i>, Brett's <i>Miscellany</i>. When Mr. Brett commenced to
  enlighten the world, and when his candle was snuffed out, I know not. My
  volume of the above work purports to be the fifth:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Containing above a hundred useful and entertaining Particulars,
  Divine, Moral, and Historical; chiefly designed for the Improvement of
  Youth, and those who have not the Opportunity of reading large Volumes.
  Interspersed with several Entertaining Things never before printed.
  Dublin, 1762."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The parish clerk's <i>bill of fares</i> is of the most seductive kind.
  Under all the above heads he has something spicy to say, either in prose
  or verse; but the marrow of the book lies in the Preface. To say that a
  man, holding the important offices of parish clerk and schoolmaster,
  could be charged with conceit, would be somewhat rash; if, therefore, in
  remarking upon the rare instance of a parish clerk becoming an author, he
  lets out that "whatever cavillers may say about his performance, they
  must admit his extensive reading, and the great labour and application
  the concoction of these books has cost him," he is but indulging in a
  feeling natural to a man of genius, and a pardonable ebullition of the
  <i>amour propre</i>. Mr. Brett seems to have been twitted with the charge
  of taking up authorship as a commercial spec; he sullenly admits that his
  book-making leaves him something, but nothing like a recompense, and
  draws an invidious comparison between one Counsellor Harris and himself;
  the <!-- Page 534 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page534"></a>{534}</span>former having received 200<i>l.</i> per
  annum for collecting materials for the <i>Life of King William III.</i>,
  while he, the schoolmaster of Castle-Knock, scarcely gets salt to his
  porridge for his <i>Collections and Observations for perpetuating the
  Honour and Glory of the King of Kings</i>.</p>

  <p>Peter farther boasts that these his volumes</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Contain the juice and marrow of many excellent and learned authors,
  but compacted after such an ingenious manner, that the learned would find
  it a great difficulty to show in what authors they are to be found!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A plan for which, I think, the learned would award him the
  <i>birch</i>. Mrs. Brett is no less a genius than her husband; and she
  takes advantage of the publication of the <i>Miscellany</i>, to stick the
  following little bill upon the back of the title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ann Brett, wife of the said Peter, at the sign of the <i>Shroud</i>
  in Christ Church Lane, opposite to the Church, makes and sells all Sorts
  of Shrouds, draws all Sorts of Patterns, does all manner of Pinking, and
  teaches Young Misses Reading and Writing, Arithmetic, and Plain Work. The
  Dublin Society," she adds, "was pleased to honour her with a handsome
  Present for her Curious Performance with the Pen."</p>

<h3>RICHARD'S "GUIDE THROUGH FRANCE."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Translated from the French on the 12th edition.
Paris: Audin, 25. Quai des Augustins.)</p>

  <p>As we are not supposed to be sensible of our own failings, I should
  much wish to know whether any English-French exists equal to some
  French-English I know of, and inclose a specimen. <span class="sc">Mr. P.
  Chasles</span> has played the critic so well with the English tongue,
  that perhaps he can find us a few specimens. Without doubt, it will be a
  wholesome correction to the Malaprop spirit if she is shown up a little;
  and I regret extremely that <span class="sc">Mr. P. Chasles</span> was
  not invited to correct the proofs of the <i>Itinéraire de France</i>.
  Here we are posting with M. Richard:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The courier à franc-étrier cannot use bridle of their own, they must
  not outrun the postilion who leads them, and the post master if they
  might arrive at, without their postillion, must not give them horse
  before this last is come. The supply-horses, according to the number of
  persons, shall be put to carriages as much as the disposition of the
  vehicles will admit. For example, three horses shall be put to
  cabriolets, and till six to the berline, but as it should not be
  possible, to put a horse en arbalête (cross-bow) without notable
  accidents, either to caleches with two horses or to the limonieres; they
  shall be obliged to pay the charge for supply horse."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here we are in a steamer, p. 52.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The sea is smooth, the sky pure, the air calm, everything promises a
  happy navigation, our boat is in a very favourable position in the middle
  of the Seine, on the right hand the hills of Honfleur, on the left the
  coast of Ingouville, let us pause a little more on these shores we are
  going to leave: behold on the east the fortifications of Havre, small
  seats! clusters of trees! this is the village of l'Eure threatened by the
  sea of an entire destruction. We must not pass over this green hill so
  delightful to view, standing on the opposite shore seamen would not
  forgive my silence, among these high trees stands a chapel dedicated to
  Notre-Dame-de-Grace. Ingouville is of 4,800 inhabitants, among which a
  great many Englishmen live there as in their own country, having their
  particular churchyard, physicians, and many occasions of hearing from
  England, which they can perceive from their pavilions. The traveller can
  go to Elbeuf by land or water. The lover of the scenes of nature will
  enjoy very romantical prospects, a new kind of view will strike his
  sight, a long train of rocks called D'Orival, the most part steep,
  covered with evergreen trees, which seem shoot out, with difficulty, of
  their craggings."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He tells us Soissons (p. 102.) "has a college, a pretty theatre, and a

  never quits her bed-down before noon, the annuitant, the rich man, are
  all brought in the same manner in these boxes. It is one of the most
  pleasant bathing establishments; it offers a peristyle, a small
  resting-room, a warming-place for linen, with partitions to prevent its
  mixture."</p>

<h3>WOMEN AND TORTOISES.</h3>

  <p>I had intended sending you a paper on Bishop Taylor's <i>Similes</i>,
  with Illustrative Notes on some Passages in his Works; but I soon found
  that your utmost indulgence could not afford me a tithe of <!-- Page 535
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page535"></a>{535}</span>the space I
  would require. Instead, therefore, send you an illustration of a single
  simile, as it is short, and not the least curious in the lot:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"All <i>vertuous women</i>, <i>like tortoises</i>, carry their house
  on their heads, and their chappel in their heart, and their danger in
  their eye, and their souls in their hands, and God in all their
  actions."&mdash;<i>Life of Christ</i>, Part I. s. ii. 4.</p>

  <p>"<i>Phidias made the statue of Venus at Elis with one foot upon the
  shell of a tortoise</i>, to signify two great duties of a virtuous woman,
  which are to keep home and be silent."&mdash;<i>Human Prudence</i>, by W.
  De Britaine, 12th edit.: Dublin, 1726, 12mo., p. 134.</p>

  <p>"Vertuous women should keep house, and 'twas well performed and
  ordered by the Greeks:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; mulier ne qua in publicum</p>
      <p>Spectandam se sine arbitro præbeat viro:'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Which made Phidias, belike, at Elis paint <i>Venus treading on a
  tortoise</i>: a symbole of women's silence and housekeeping.... I know
  not what philosopher he was, that would have women come but thrice abroad
  all their time, to be <i>baptized</i>, <i>married</i>, <i>and buried</i>;
  but he was too straitlaced."&mdash;Burton's <i>Anat. Mel.</i>, part iii.
  sec. 3. mem. 4. subs. 2.</p>

  <p>"<i>Apelles us'd to paint a good housewife upon a snayl</i>; which
  intimated that she should be as slow from gadding abroad, and when she
  went she shold carry her house upon her back: that is, she shold make all
  sure at home. Now, to a good housewife, her house shold be as the sphere
  to a star (I do not mean a <i>wandring</i> star), wherin she shold
  twinckle as a star in its orb."&mdash;Howell's <i>Parly of Beasts</i>:
  Lond. 1660, p. 58.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The last passage reminds us of the fine lines of Donne (addressed to
  <i>both</i> sexes):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Be then thine own home, and in thyself dwell;</p>
      <p class="i1">Inn anywhere;</p>
      <p>And seeing the <i>snail</i>, which everywhere doth roam,</p>
      <p>Carrying his own home still, still is at home,</p>
      <p>Follow (for he is easy-paced) this <i>snail</i>:</p>
      <p>Be thine own palace, or the world's thy jail."</p>

<h3>WEATHER RULES.</h3>

  <p>J. A., Jun., being desirous of forming a list of weather rules, I send

  interesting to those of your readers who have never met with the old

      <p>Winter thunder, a summer's wonder.</p>

      <p>April and May, the keys of the year.</p>
      <p>A cold April, much bread and little wine.</p>
      <p>A year of snow, a year of plenty.</p>
      <p>A red morning, wind or rain.</p>
      <p>The moon with a circle brings water in her beak.</p>
      <p>Bearded frost, forerunner of snow.</p>
      <p>Neither give credit to a clear winter nor cloudy spring.</p>
      <p>Clouds above, water below.</p>
      <p>When the moon is in the wane do not sow anything.</p>
      <p>A red sun has water in his eye.</p>
      <p>Red clouds in the east, rain the next day.</p>
      <p>An eastern wind carrieth water in his hand.</p>
      <p>A March sun sticks like a lock of wool.</p>
      <p>When there is a spring in winter, and a winter in spring, the year is never good.</p>
      <p>When it rains in August, it rains wine or honey.</p>
      <p>The circle of the moon never filled a pond, but the circle of the sun wets a shepherd.</p>

      <p>In August, neither ask for olives, chesnuts, nor acorns.</p>
      <p>January commits the fault, and May bears the blame.</p>
      <p>A year of snow, a year of plenty.</p>

      <p>January or February do fill or empty the granary.</p>

<h3>OCCASIONAL FORMS OF PRAYER.</h3>

  <p>I now send you a list of Occasional Forms of Prayer in my own
  possession, in the hope that the example may be followed by other
  individuals.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>A Fourme to be used in Common Prayer table twise a Weke, and also an
  Order of Publique Fast to be used every Wednesday, &amp;c. during this
  time of Mortalitie, &amp;c. London, 1563.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was the first published occasional form of the reign of
  Elizabeth.</p>

<p><!-- Page 536 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page536"></a>{536}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>A Fourme to be used in Common Prayer every Sunday, Wednesday, and
  Friday throughout the whole Realme: to excite and stirre up all Godly
  People to pray for the Preservation of those Christians and their
  Countreys that are now invaded by the Turke in Hungary or elsewhere. Set
  fourthe by The Reverend Father in God, Matthew, Archbishop of Cantaburie.
  Imprinted by Richarde Jugge and John Cawood. 4to.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is no date; but it is ascertained that this form was put forth
  in the year 1566.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The Order of Prayer and other Exercises upon Wednesdays and Fridays,
  &amp;c. 4to. Christopher Barker. 1580.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was put forth in consequence of an earthquake.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Prayers. 1584.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>They consist of "A Prayer for all Kings," &amp;c., "A Prayer for the
  Queene," &amp;c., and "A Prayer in the Parliament onely." They are
  appended to <i>Treasons of Pary</i>, forming part of the volume.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>An Order for Prayer and Thanksgiving for the Safety of Her Majesty.
  1594.</p>

  <p>Certaine Prayers set forth by Authoritie to be used for the Prosperous
  Successe of her Majesties Forces and Navy. 4to. The Deputies of
  Christopher Barker, 1597.</p>

  <p>An Order for Prayer and Thanksgiving (necessary in these dangerous
  Times) for the Safety of her Majestie and the Realme. 4to. The Deputies
  of C. Barker. <i>No date.</i></p>

  <p>An Order for Publike Prayers within the Province of Canterbury. No
  date. By the Queen's Printer.</p>

  <p>Prayers for the Queen's safe Deliverance, London, 1605.</p>

  <p>Form of Prayer, &amp;c. Nov. 5. London, 1605.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The original edition.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Form of Prayer, &amp;c., Nov. 5. London, 1620.</p>

  <p>Form, &amp;c. for the 5th of August, being the Day of His Highnesse's
  happy Deliverance from the Earle of Gowry. London, 1623.</p>

  <p>Form, &amp;c. Fast during the Plague. 1625.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The "Prayer for the Parliament" appears for the first time in this
  form.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Form, &amp;c. Fast. War and Pestilence. 1626.</p>

  <p>Form, &amp;c. Fast. War. 1628.</p>

  <p>Forme of Prayer, &amp;c. for averting God's heauy Visitation, &amp;c.
  1636.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the form which was attacked by Burton and Prynne, and on which
  a charge was raised against Laud.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Form, &amp;c. Fast. Plague. 1640</p>

  <p>Form, &amp;c. Fast. War. Oxford, 1643.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the form authorised by Charles I. to be used at the
  commencement of the war. It is frequently alluded to by the Parliamentary
  writers of the period. The House of Commons had ordered a monthly fast,
  and Charles commanded that the second Friday in every month should be set
  apart for the same purpose. This form was to be used on such
  occasions.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Form, &amp;c. Fast. Oxford, 1643.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same as the preceding, but a different edition, one being in
  black-letter, the other in Roman. Both were printed in Oxford, and in the
  same year.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>A Collection of Prayers and Thanksgivings used in His Majesties Chapel
  and in his Armies, upon occasion of the late Victories against the
  Rebels. Oxford, 1643.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was reprinted at York in 1644.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The Cavaliers' New Common Prayer Booke, unclasp't. Reprinted at
  London, with some briefe and necessary Obseruations to refute the Lyes
  and Scandalls that are contained in it. 1644.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is a reprint of the preceding form, with a scurrilous preface and
  observations. The prayers are given as they stand in the Royal form, but
  with parenthetical sentences of a most abusive character after almost
  every paragraph. Thus, after the clause, "Pity a despised Church," the
  authors add, "You mean the prelates and their hierarchy." After the next
  clause, "and a distracted State," they add, "made so by your wicked
  party." In one of the thanksgivings, after "Glory be to God," we have,
  "Your mock prayers defraud Him of His glory." Then, after the words "We
  praise thee, we bless thee," &amp;c., from the Communion Office, we have,
  "Softly, lest you want breath, and thank the old Common Prayer Book for
  that."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Private Forms for these Sad Times. Oxford, 1645.</p>

  <p>A Form of Thanksgiving, to be used the Seventh Day of September,
  thorowout the Diocese of Lincoln, and in the Jurisdiction of
  Westminster.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This remarkable form has no date, but it was put forth by Williams,
  then Bishop of Lincoln and Dean of Westminster, in the year 1641. The
  House of Commons had ordered a day of Thanksgiving; but they were greatly
  offended with Williams, on account of this form, and, instead of going to
  St. Margaret's Church as usual, where it was ordered to be read, they
  attended divine service, after their own fashion, in the chapel of
  Lincoln's Inn.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>A Supply of Prayers for the Ships of this Kingdom that want Ministers
  to pray with them agreeable to the Directory, &amp;c. London. Published
  by authority.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A Presbyterian form, and the only one ever published by men who
  decried all forms. It was put forth, as the preface admits, because the
  sailors clung to the Book of Common Prayer.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Prayers to be used in the Armies. 1648.</p>

  <p>A Form of Prayer used at His Majesties Chapel at the Hague. 1650.</p>

  <p>Prayers for those who mourn, &amp;c. 1659.</p>

  <p>Form of Common Prayer, to be used on the Thirtieth of January, &amp;c.
  1661.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This form differs materially from that subsequently put forth by
  Convocation, with the revised Prayer Book of 1662. There was also another
  form still earlier, in the year 1661, in which some singular and
  obnoxious petitions relative to Charles I. were found. <!-- Page 537
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page537"></a>{537}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>A Form of Prayer with Thanksgiving, to be used on the 29th of May,
  1661.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The original edition. It differs from that which was sanctioned by
  Convocation and published in 1662.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Form of Prayer, &amp;c. June 12. Fast during a Dearth. 1661.</p>

  <p>Form, &amp;c. Fast during a Sickness. 1661.</p>

  King, the Queen, and the Royal Family, upon occasion of the Queen's being

</blockquote>

  <p>This form was the occasion of much comment at the time.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>A Form of Prayer with Thanksgiving, &amp;c., for the Birth of the
  Prince. 1688.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Chair Moving.</i>&mdash;Recent occurrences made me look back at
  Glanvill's <i>Blow at Modern Sadducism</i>, and I observed that in his
  account of the "Dæmon of Tedworth," who was supposed to haunt the house
  of Mr. Mompesson, and who was the original of Addison's "drummer," it is
  stated that on the 5th November, 1662, "in the sight and presence of the
  company, the chairs walked about the room," p. 124.</p>

  <p><i>The early Delights of Philadelphia.</i>&mdash;In Gabriel Thomas's
  <i>Description of the Settlement of Philadelphia</i> occurs the following
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the said city are several good schools of learning for youth, for
  the attainment of arts and sciences, also reading and writing. Here is to
  be had, on any day in the week, cakes, tarts, and pies; we have also
  several cook-shops, both roasting and boiling, as in the city of London:
  happy blessings, for which we owe the highest gratitude to our plentiful
  Provider, the great Creator of heaven and earth."</p>

  <p>Is not this a superb jumble?</p>

  <p><i>Misapplication of Terms.</i>&mdash;<i>Legend</i> is a thing "to be
  read" (<i>legendum</i>), but it is often improperly applied to traditions
  and <i>oral</i> communications. Of this there have been some instances in
  "N. &amp; Q." One has just turned up, Vol. v., p. 196.: "I send you these
  legends <i>as I have heard them from the lips</i> of my nurse, a native
  of the parish."</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Gold Collar found in Staffordshire.</i>&mdash;It may
  probably interest some of your readers to <!-- Page 538 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page538"></a>{538}</span>know that a very
  ancient golden collar was lately found in the village of Stanton,
  Staffordshire, which is about three miles north of Ashbourne.</p>

  <p>A labourer digging up a field, which had not been ploughed or dug up
  in the memory of man, turned up the collar, which, being curled up at the
  time, sprang up, and the labourer taking it for a snake, struck it out of
  his way with his spade: the next morning it was discovered not to be a
  snake. Unfortunately the blow had broken off a small piece at one end.
  The collar is now in the possession of the person with whom the curate of
  Stanton lodges. The description given to me is, that it is about two feet
  long, and formed of three pieces of gold twined together, and, with the
  above exception, in a very good state of preservation.</p>

  <p>I hear that there is a similar collar in the British Museum, that was
  found in Ireland, but none that was found in England; and that the
  authorities of the Museum have been informed of this collar, but have
  taken no steps to obtain possession of it.</p>

  <p>[Our correspondent is under an erroneous impression as to gold torques
  not being found in England. Several are figured in the

  particulars, resembles one which formed part of the celebrated Polden
  find described by Mr. Harford in the fourteenth volume of the
  <i>Archæologia</i>, and figured at p. 90.; and also that found at Boyton

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>PICTURES IN HAMPTON COURT PALACE.</h3>

  <p>There are two or three of these concerning which I should be obliged
  to any reader of your publication who would satisfy my Queries.</p>

  <p>No. 119., "The Battle of Forty," by P. Snayers. This seems a kind of
  <i>combat à outrance</i> of knights <i>armés de pied en cap</i>. Where
  can I find any account or detail of it?</p>

  <p>No. 314., "Mary of Lorraine, mother of Mary Queen of Scots." This is a
  very pleasing picture, in good preservation, and as it was not in its
  present position two years ago, I conclude it has recently been added.
  She was ninth child of Claude de Lorraine, first Duc de Guise, born in
  1515, and married in 1538 to James V. of Scotland, and she died in the
  forty-fifth year of her age, 10th June, 1560. There are the arms of the
  Guise family in the right-hand corner, with a date of 1611. Pray by whom
  was it painted, and where can find any notices respecting it?</p>

  <p>No. 166., "George III. reviewing the 10th Light Dragoons, commanded by
  the Prince of Wales." This picture was considered the <i>chef
  d'&oelig;uvre</i> of Sir William Beechey, and was painted in 1798; and it
  has been supposed the likeness of the Duke of York was the best taken of
  that Prince. Could any reader inform me on what day this review took
  place?<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>When one sees a picture of Shakspeare, No. 276., and more especially
  in the palace of his cotemporary sovereigns, one is naturally led to
  inquire into its authenticity. I am therefore desirous to obtain some
  information relative to it.</p>

  <p>In "N. &amp; Q.," vol. vi., p. 197., you had several correspondents
  inquiring concerning the custom of royalty dining in public: perhaps it
  may interest them to know that there are two very attractive pictures of
  this ceremony in this collection, numbered 293 and 294: the first is of
  Charles I. and Henrietta Maria; the other Frederick V., Count Palatine
  and King of Bohemia, who married Elizabeth, daughter of James I. These
  two pictures are by Van Bassen, of whom, perhaps, some correspondent may
  be enabled to give an account.</p>

  <p>George III. had one or two copies of this picture taken for him; and
  there is a curious circumstance relative to one of these, which Lady
  Chatterton mentions in her <i>Home Sketches</i>, published in three vols.
  8vo., 1841: "In one respect the picture (which George III. gave to Lord
  Sidmouth, and which the latter had put up at the stone lodge in Richmond
  New Park) differs from the original at Hampton Court: it is singular
  enough that in this copy the figure of the Prince is omitted, <i>which
  was done by the King's desire</i>, and is a striking and rather comical
  proof of the dislike which he felt towards his son. When the Prince
  became King, he dined here, and remarked to Lord Sidmouth that his
  portrait had been omitted, and hinted that it ought to be restored. This,
  however, was evaded, and the copy remains in its original
  state."&mdash;Vol. i. pp. 18, 19.</p>

  <p><i>Pope's Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady.</i>&mdash;In the new editions
  of Pope's <i>Works</i>, in course of publication, edited by Mr.
  Carruthers, Inverness, it is conjectured that the poet threw "ideal
  circumstances" into his most pathetic and melodious elegy, and "when he
  came to publish his letters, put wrong initials, as in other instances,
  to conceal the real names" (Pope's <i>Poet. Works</i>, Ingram, Cook, and
  Co., vol. ii. p. 184.). The initials are Mrs. W., niece of Lady A. I have
  always thought that a clue might be obtained to the name of this lady, by
  following up the hints in Pope's printed correspondence. Mrs. or Miss W.
  is mentioned or alluded to by Craggs and Pope, in connexion with the
  characters in the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>. One suggests the other.
  Inquiry should be directed to the families of Fernor of Tusmore, Lord
  Petre, and Sir George Brown. But I have heard a tradition in a Catholic
  family in the north of England that the lady was a Blount; probably one
  of the Blounts of Soddington, or of some one of the numerous branches of
  that ancient family.</p>

<h2>Replies.</h2>

<h3>ATTAINMENT OF MAJORITY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 198. 250.)</p>

  <p>In replying to Professor <span class="sc">De Morgan's</span> last
  communication on this subject, it may be as well, in order to avoid
  future misunderstanding, to revert briefly to my original question. I
  pointed out Ben Jonson's assertion, through a character in one of his
  plays, that about the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was the
  custom to regard the legal rights of majority as commencing with six
  o'clock <span class="scac">A.M.</span>, and I asked to have that
  assertion reconciled with our present commencement at midnight, and with
  the statement that the latter is in accordance with the old
  reckoning.</p>

  <p>Thus I started with the production of affirmative evidence, to rebut
  which I cannot find, in the replies of <span class="sc">Professor De
  Morgan</span>, any negative evidence stronger than his individual
  opinion, which, however eminent in other respects, has undoubtedly the
  disadvantage of being two hundred years later than the contemporary
  evidence produced by me. I afterwards cited Arthur Hopton as authority
  that lawyers in England, in his time, did make use of a day which he
  classifies as that of the Babylonians; but inasmuch as he apparently
  restricts its duration to twelve hours, whereas all ancient writers
  concur in assigning to the Babylonians a day of twenty-four hours, there
  is evidently a mistake somewhere, attributable either to Hopton or his
  printers.</p>

  <p>This mistake may have arisen either from a misprint, or from a
  transposition of a portion of the sentence.</p>

  <p>The supposition of a misprint is favoured by the circumstance that
  Hopton was, at the time, professing to describe natural days of
  <i>twenty-four</i> hours; of these there are four great classes of
  commencement, from the four principal quarters of the day; viz. from
  midnight, from mid-day, from sun-setting and from sun-rising. Hopton had
  already assigned three of them to different nations, and the fourth he
  had properly assigned, so far as its commencement at sunrise was
  concerned, to the Babylonians. What, then, can be more probable than that
  he intended this day also, like the rest, to be of twenty-four hours'
  duration; and that the words "holding till sun-setting" ought, perhaps,
  to have been printed "holding till sun-<i>rising</i>?"</p>

  <p>This way of reconciling seeming anomalies, by the supposition of
  probable misprints, receives great encouragement in the occasional
  occurrence of similar mistakes in the most carefully printed modern
  books. I lately noticed, while reading Sir James Ross's <i>Southern
  Voyage of Discovery</i>, a work printed by the Admiralty, and on which
  extraordinary typographical care had been bestowed, the following, at
  page 121. of vol. ii.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was full moon on the 15th of September, at 5·38 <span
  class="scac">A.M.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But the context shows that "full moon" ought to have been printed
  <i>new moon</i>, and that "5·38 <span class="scac">A.M.</span>" outlet to
  be 5·38 <span class="scac">P.M.</span>: and what renders these two
  mistakes the more remarkable is, that they have no sort of connexion, nor
  is the occurrence of the one in any way explanatory of the other.</p>

  <p>Now, the misprint of "sun-setting" for <i>sun-rising</i>, which I am
  supposing in Hopton's book, would be much more likely of occurrence than
  these, because these form part of a series of carefully examined data
  from which a scientific deduction is to be drawn, while Hopton's is a
  mere loose description. And, moreover, a twenty-four hour day, commencing
  and ending with <i>sunrise</i>, does not, after all, appear to be so
  wholly unknown to English law as <span class="sc">Prof. De Morgan</span>
  supposes, since Sir Edward Coke, to whom the professor especially refers,
  describes such a day in these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Dies naturalis constat ea 24 horis et continet diem solarem et
  noctem; and therefore in Inditements for Burglary and the like, we say in
  nocte ejusdem diei. Iste dies naturalis est spatium in quo sol
  progreditur ab oriente in occidentem et ab occidente iterum in
  orientem."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 542 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page542"></a>{542}</span></p>

  <p>But there is another way of reconciling the discrepancy&mdash;Hopton
  may not have intended the words "holding till sun-setting" to apply to
  the Babylonians, but only to "the lawyers in England," whose day, he
  says, <i>commenced</i> at the same time as the Babylonian day. The
  transposition of the words in question to the end of the sentence would
  give such a meaning, viz. "The Babylonians begin their day at sun-rising,
  and so do our lawyers count it in England, holding till sun-setting."
  Altered in this way, the latter clause does not necessarily apply to the
  Babylonians.</p>

  <p>Here again we have a lawyers' day almost verbally identical with one
  assigned to them by Sir Edward Coke: "Dies artificialis sive solaris
  incipit in ortu solis et desinit in occasu, and of this the law of
  England takes hold <i>in many cases</i>."</p>

  <p>Nor does Lord Coke strengthen or vary his description in the least,
  when speaking of the day commencing at midnight; he uses again the same
  expression with regard to it, "The Egyptians and Romans from midnight,
  and so doth the law of England <i>in many cases</i>."</p>

  <p>Hence the authority of Chief Justice Coke, is at best only neutral;
  for who will undertake to prove to which of these classes of "many cases"
  Lord Coke meant to assign the attainment of majority?</p>

  <p>In support of Ben Jonson's testimony, it may be urged that the
  midnight initial of the day was itself derived by us from the Romans; and
  it is nearly certain that <i>they</i> did not perform any legal act,
  connected with birthday, until the commencement of the <i>dies
  solis</i>.</p>

  <p>A proof of this may be observed in the discussion by Aulus Gellius
  (<i>Noct. Attic.</i>, iii. 2.) as to which day, the preceding or the
  following, a person's birth, happening in the night, was to be
  attributed. He quotes a fragment from Varro,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Homines qui ex media nocte ad proximam mediam noctem his horis <span
  class="scac">XXIV</span> nati sunt, uno die nati dicuntur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On which Gellius remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"From these words it may be observed that the arrangement of (birth)
  days was such, that to any person born after sunset, and before midnight,
  the day from which that night had proceeded should be the birthday; but
  to any person born during the last six hours of the night, the day which
  should succeed that night must be the birthday."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This explanation might seem almost purposely written in reply to some
  such difficulty as occurred to <span class="sc">Professor de
  Morgan</span> (<i>antè</i>, p. 250.), when he remarks that, if birthday
  were to be confined to daylight, "a child not born by daylight would have
  no birthday at all!" But since it was notorious amongst the Romans that
  the civil day began at midnight, such a <i>quæri solitum</i> as this
  could never have been mooted, if the birthday observance had not been
  known and acknowledged to have a different commencement. In continuation
  of the same subject, Gellius proceeds to quote another passage from
  Varro, which I shall also repeat, not only as furnishing still farther
  proof that the Romans did not regard the night as forming any part of the
  birthday, but also as affording an opportunity of recording an opinion as
  to the interpretation of Varro's words, which, in this passage, do not
  appear to have ever been properly understood.</p>

  <p>After stating that many persons in Umbria reckon from noon to noon as
  one and the same day, Varro remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quod quidem nimis absurdum est; nam qui calendarum hora sexta natus
  est apud Umbros, dies ejus natalis videri debebit et calendarum
  dimidiatus, et qui est post calendas dies ante horam ejusdem diei
  sextam."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now why should <i>beginning one's birthday at noon</i> appear so
  absurd to Varro? Simply because the hours of the night were not then
  supposed to be included in the birthday at all, and therefore Varro could
  not <i>realize</i> the idea of a birthday continued through the
  night.</p>

  <p>He says that, according to the Umbrian reckoning, a person born on any
  day <i>after</i> the point of noon, would have only half a birthday on
  that day; and for the other half, he would have to take the forenoon of
  the following day. Varro had no notion of joining the afternoon of one
  day to the forenoon of another, because he looked upon the unbroken
  presence of the sun as the very essence of a natal day.</p>

  <p>Nothing can be plainer than that this was the true nature of the
  absurdity alluded to; but it would not suit the prejudices of the
  commentators, because it would compel them to admit that <i>sexta hora
  must have been in the afternoon</i>, in opposition to their favourite
  dogma that it was always in the forenoon.</p>

  <p>For if Varro had intended to represent sexta hora in the
  <i>forenoon</i>, he would have said that the other half-day must be taken
  from the <i>after</i>noon of the <i>pridie</i>, instead of saying, as he
  does say, that it must be taken from the <i>fore</i>noon of the
  <i>postridie</i> of the Calends.</p>

  <p>Consequently, Varro means by "qui Calendarum hora sexta natus est," a
  person born in the sixth hour of the day of the Calends; the sixth hour
  being that which immediately succeeded noon&mdash;the <i>media hora</i>
  of Ovid. But what Varro more immediately means by it is, not any
  particular point of time, but generally any time <i>after noon</i> on the
  day of the Calends.</p>

  <p>That the true position of <i>sexta hora</i>, when implying duration,
  was in the afternoon, has long been a conviction of mine; and I have
  elsewhere produced undeniable evidence that it was so <!-- Page 543
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page543"></a>{543}</span>considered by
  ancient authors. But this passage from Varro is a new and hitherto
  unnoticed proof, and certainly it ought to be a most convincing one,
  because it seems impossible to give Varro's words a rational meaning
  without the admission of this hypothesis, while with it everything is
  clear and consistent.</p>

  <p>The commentators, driven by the necessity I have just pointed out,
  either to admit the afternoon position of <i>sexta hora</i>, or to
  abstain from reading it as a <i>space</i> of time, have attempted to
  force a meaning by reading <i>sexta hora</i> in its other sense, an
  absolute mathematical point, the <i>punctus ipse</i> of noon.</p>

  <p>In so doing they have not scrupled to libel Varro's common sense; they
  represent his idea of the absurd to consist in the embarrassment that
  would be caused by the birth occurring at the critical moment of
  change,&mdash;split as it were <i>upon the knife-edge of noon</i>; so
  that, in the doubt that would arise as to which day it should belong, it
  must be attributed partly to both!</p>

  <p>This interpretation is so monstrous, and so evidently wide of the
  meaning of the words, that its serious imputation would scarcely be
  believed, if it were not embalmed in the Delphin edition of Aulus
  Gellius, where we read the following footnote referring to the
  <i>argumentum ad absurdum</i> of Varro:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Infirmum omnino argumentum, et quod perinde potest in ipsum Varronem
  retorqueri. Quid enim? Si quis apud Romanos Calendis hora vi. noctis
  fuerit natus, nonne pariter dies ejus natalis videri debebit, et partim
  Calendarum, et partim ejus dici qui sequetur?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is not worth while to inquire what may have been the precise
  dilemma contemplated by the writer of this note, since most certainly it
  is not a reflex of Varro's meaning. The word <i>dimidiatus</i> is
  completely cushioned, although Gellius himself has a chapter upon it a
  little farther on in the same volume.</p>

  <p>The anomaly that amused Varro was the necessity of piecing together
  two halves not belonging to the same individual day and with the hiatus
  of a night between them; a necessity that would assuredly appear most
  absurd to one who had no other idea of birthday than the twelve
  consecutive hours of artificial day, which he would call "the natural
  day."</p>

  <p>This proneness of the Romans to look upon the <i>dies solis</i> as the
  only effective part of the twenty-four hours, is again apparent in their
  commencement of horary notation at sunrise, six hours later than the
  actual commencement of the day. And in our own anomalous repetition of
  twice twelve, we may still trace the remains of the twelve-hour day; we
  have changed the initial point, but we have retained the measure of
  duration.</p>

  <p>It is, however, certain that the two methods of reckoning time
  continued for a long time to exist contemporaneously. Hence it became
  necessary to distinguish one from the other <i>by name</i>, and thus the
  notation from midnight gave rise, as I have remarked in one of my papers
  on Chaucer, to the English idiomatic phrase "of the clock;" or the
  reckoning of the clock, commencing at midnight, as distinguished from
  Roman equinoctial hours, commencing at six o'clock <span
  class="scac">A.M.</span> This was what Ben Jonson was meaning by
  attainment of majority at <i>six o'clock</i>, and not, as <span
  class="sc">Professor De Morgan</span> supposes, "probably a certain
  sunrise." Actual sunrise had certainly nothing to do with the technical
  commencement of the day in Ben Jonson's time. For convenience sake, six
  o'clock had long been taken <i>as conventional sunrise all the year
  round</i>; and even amongst the Romans themselves, equinoctial hours were
  frequently used at all seasons. Actual sunrise, in after times, had only
  to do with "hours inequall," which are said to have fallen into disuse,
  in common life, so early as the fifth or sixth century.</p>

  <p>I trust I may now have shown reasonable grounds for the belief that
  Ben Jonson may, after all, have had better authority than his license as
  a dramatic poet, for dating the attainment of majority at six o'clock
  <span class="scac">A.M.</span>; and that nothing short of contemporary
  evidence directly contradictory of the custom so circumstantially alluded
  to by him, ought to be held sufficient to throw discredit upon it. It is
  one of the singular coincidences attending the discussion of this matter
  by Gellius, that, at the conclusion of the chapter I have been
  expatiating upon, he should cite the authority of Virgil; observing that
  the testimony of <i>poets</i> is very valuable upon such subjects, even
  when veiled in the obscurity of poetic imagery.</p>

<h3>LORD HALIFAX AND MRS. CATHERINE BARTON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p 429.)</p>

  <p>Your Correspondent <span class="sc">Prof. De Morgan</span> has so
  ingeniously analysed the facts, which he already possesses, bearing on
  the connexion of Sir Isaac Newton's niece with Lord Halifax, and her
  designation in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, that I am tempted to
  furnish him with some additional evidence. This question of Mrs.
  Catherine Barton's widowhood has often been canvassed by that portion of
  her relatives who do not possess the custody of Sir Isaac Newton's
  private letters.</p>

  <p>The Montagues had a residence in the village of Bregstock in
  Northamptonshire, where the Bartons lived. The Bartons were a family of
  good descent, and had long been lessees of the crown with the Montagues
  for lands near Braystock.</p>

  <p>There were several Colonel Bartons, whose respective ages and
  relationship can best be <!-- Page 544 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page544"></a>{544}</span>exhibited by a short pedigree. Thomas
  Barton had two sons, Thomas and Robert.</p>

  <p>Robert (born in 1630, and who died in 1693) married Hannah Smith,
  Newton's half-sister, by whom he had Hannah (born 1678), Catherine (born
  1679, died 1739), Colonel Robert (born 1684).</p>

  <p>Thomas (born in 1619, died in 1704) married Alice Palmer, by whom he
  had Thomas, who married Mary Dale, by whom he had Thomas (d. s. p.),
  Colonel Matthew (born 1672), Colonel Noel (born 1674, died 1714). Thomas
  had a second son, Geoffrey, who married Elizabeth &mdash;&mdash;, by whom
  he had Charles (born 1700), Cutts (born 1706), Catherine (born 1709),
  Montague (born 1717), and others.</p>

  <p>In a family paper written by a granddaughter of Colonel Noel Barton,
  at her mother's dictation, it is stated that Colonel Matthew married a
  relative of Sir Isaac Newton, and was Comptroller of the Mint; but this
  paper is not very correct in its other statements.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a connexion of the family who signs himself H. in
  an old number of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, says of Newton:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He had a half-sister, who had a daughter, to whom he gave the best of
  educations, the famous witty Miss Barton, who married Mr. Conduit of the
  Mint."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Conduit writes, that his wife lived twenty years before and after
  her marriage with Sir Issac.</p>

  <p>I had always thought that Catherine Barton's brother Robert had died
  too early to attain the rank of Colonel. In the British Museum, in the
  Register, there is an account of a sermon preached at the funeral of
  Robert Barton in the year 1703. I could not find the sermon.</p>

  <p>The famous Duchess of Marlborough thus satirises Mouse Montague:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was a frightful figure, and yet pretended to be a lover; and
  followed several beauties, who laughed at him for it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is worth mentioning that Colonel Noel Barton died in London in
  1714, while in attendance on his patron Lord Gainsborough, soon after he
  had been appointed Governor of the Leeward Islands. This was the year
  before Lord Halifax's <i>Life</i> was written, and possibly might have
  been the cause of the designation "Widow" being applied to Catherine
  Barton by mistake. Whatever the connexion of this lady with Lord Halifax
  may have been, it does not seem to have given any offence to her
  relatives. You will observe that Geoffrey Barton names his sons Charles
  and Montague, and his daughter Catherine. Charles afterwards received the
  rectory of St. Andrew's Holborn from the family of Montague; and Cutts
  was Dean of Bristol under Bishop Montague. And Montague obtained
  preferment from Mr. Conduit. Neither the family of Montague, nor that of
  Barton, seem to have thought the connexion discreditable. Moreover, the
  births of these children of Geoffrey Barton, a clergyman, occurred at the
  very period when the name of Catherine should have been most distasteful,
  had the intimacy been dishonourable.</p>

  <p>Mr. Conduit died in the year 1738, and Mrs. Conduit in the year 1739;
  and Catherine Conduit did not become Lady Lymington till 1740. Probably
  both Mr. and Mrs. Conduit made wills. Have they been examined at Doctors'
  Commons?</p>

<h3>MILTON'S WIDOW.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 12. 134. 200. 375. 452. 471.)</p>

  <p>It is pleasing to find so much interest excited among the readers of
  "N. &amp; Q." relative to the parentage of this lady; and we may fairly
  hope that the spirit of research which has thus been awakened, will not
  die away until the last spark of error and mystery has been
  extinguished.</p>

  <p>T. L. P. has favoured us with quotations from a little pamphlet,
  entitled <i>Historical Facts connected with Nantwich and its
  Neighbourhood</i>. Now, after giving this work a most careful perusal, I
  cannot but think that the title of the book is, in this instance at
  least, a misnomer. The authoress, for it was written by a lady long
  resident in the vicinity, has evidently wrought upon the foundations of
  others; and taking the veteran Ormerod as a sufficient authority, has
  given full vent to her imagination, and pictured, with "no 'prentice
  hand," the welcome visits of Milton to Stoke Hall, a place which, in all
  probability, was never once honoured with the presence of this great man.
  There is no evidence whatever adduced to give even the semblance of
  colour to this unfortunate error; whereas, on the side of the Wistaston
  family, the proofs of its identity as the family of Mrs. Milton are
  numerous and, to my notion, incontrovertible.</p>

  <p>As if, indeed, to give us "confirmation sure" of the truth of this
  position, our old friend <span class="sc">Cranmore</span> starts up,
  "like a spirit from the vasty deep," and, after an absence of many months
  from our ranks, pays off his ancient score by producing the evidence he
  so long ago promised us. From it we gather that Thomas Paget, the father,
  named his <i>cousin</i> Minshull, apothecary in Manchester, overseer of
  his will; and that his son, Nathan Paget, eighteen years afterwards,
  names in his will John Goldsmith and Elizabeth Milton as <i>his
  cousins</i>, and makes bequests to them accordingly. Now, it so happens
  that Thomas, son of Richard Minshull of Wistaston, was an
  <i>apothecary</i>, and that he settled in <i>Manchester</i>, and
  thereupon founded the family of Minshull of Manchester. This <!-- Page
  545 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page545"></a>{545}</span>gentleman
  was doubtless the <i>cousin</i> referred to in the will of the elder
  Paget. It farther happens, that Thomas Minshull, the grandfather of this
  Manchester apothecary, married a daughter of Goldsmith of Nantwich. The
  John Goldsmith of the Middle Temple would then doubtless be the nephew or
  grand-nephew of this lady, and in either case a <i>cousin</i> of Thomas
  Minshull of Manchester, and of Elizabeth Minshull of Wistaston. This is
  another, if not a completing link in the genealogical chain, and
  convinces me, now more than ever, of the correctness of my
  conclusions.</p>

  <p>I may add that the whole of the deeds referred to by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> are now in the safe and worthy keeping of
  Mr. J. Fitchett Marsh of Warrington; and that they are published <i>in
  extenso</i>, together with a valuable essay on their historical
  importance by their present possessor, in the first volume of
  <i>Miscellanies</i> issued by the Chetham Society.</p>

<h3>ANTICIPATORY USE OF THE CROSS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 132. 417.)</p>

  <p>I am not sure that any of your correspondents have noticed the
  resemblance between the letter T t, especially in some of its ancient
  forms, and the form of the cross. In the Greek, Etruscan, and Samaritan
  forms of this letter, we have representations of the three principal
  forms which the cross has assumed: <a href="images/tsquare.png"><img
  src="images/tsquare.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="Tau
  cross" /></a>, &dagger;, ×. It is also remarkable that in Ezekiel ix. 4.
  6.: "Set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry,"
  &amp;c., the word rendered "mark" is <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="TW" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;&#x5BC;&#x5D5;</bdo></span>
  (<i>Tau</i>), the name of the Hebrew letter answering to the above: and
  as the Samaritan alphabet, which the present Hebrew characters have
  superseded, was then in use, it is highly probable that the "mark"
  referred to in Ezekiel's vision was the Samaritan <i>Tau</i>, as seen on
  ancient Hebrew shekels, resembling a St. Andrew's cross.</p>

  <p>A circumstance relating to the Paschal sacrifice mentioned by Justin
  Martyr, in his conference with Trypho the Jew, and which he asserts
  without contradiction from his learned opponent, is worthy of a note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This lamb, which was to be roasted whole, was a symbol of the
  punishment of the cross, which was inflicted on Christ, <span title="To gar optômenon probaton, k.t.l." class="grk"
  >&Tau;&omicron; &gamma;&alpha;&rho;
  &omicron;&pi;&tau;&omega;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu;
  &pi;&rho;&omicron;&beta;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&nu;,
  &kappa;.&tau;.&lambda;.</span> For the lamb which was roasted was so
  placed as to resemble the figure of a cross; with one spit it was pierced
  longitudinally, from the tail to the head; with another it was transfixed
  through the shoulders, so that the forelegs became extended."&mdash;Vid.
  Just. Martyri <i>Opera</i>, edit. Oberther, vol. ii. p. 106.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Your correspondent H.&nbsp;N. appears to have fallen into several errors,
  which (having appeared in "N. &amp; Q.") ought not to pass unnoticed.</p>

  <p>1. He confounds the basilica with the cruciform cathedral, and with
  "the plan of the Roman forum."</p>

  <p>Basilica (from Gr. <span title="Basilikê" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F74;</span>, a royal
  dwelling) was the name given by the Romans to those public edifices in
  which justice was administered and mercantile business transacted.
  Several of these buildings, or the remains of them, still exist in Rome,
  each forum probably having had its basilica. Vitruvius, who constructed
  one at Fanum, says it ought to be built "on the warm side of the forum,
  that those whose affairs call them thither might confer without being
  incommoded by the weather." Yet H.&nbsp;N. says: "The basilica seems to have
  originally been the architectural plan of the Roman forum." The most
  perfect specimen of the antique basilica is that discovered at Pompeii,
  on the south side of the form and at right angles with it. By consulting
  a good plan of Pompeii, or glancing at a plan of its basilica, any one
  may see that it was not cruciform, but "in the form of a long
  parallelogram," with a central space and side porticoes, answering to the
  nave and aisles of a church. The early Christians adopted the basilica
  form for their churches: those built in the form of a Greek or Latin
  cross are of much later date. Yet H.&nbsp;N.'s learned friend exclaims, when
  viewing the temple of Muttra, "Here is the cross! the basilica carried
  out with more correctness of order and symmetry than in Italy!"</p>

  <p>2. H. N. assumes that the Jews practised crucifixion as a punishment,
  and "may have imitated the Assyrians, as crucifixion may have been
  adopted long before that of Christ and the two thieves (Qy. robbers)."
  Crucifixion appears to have been in use from a very remote period, but
  was never adopted by the Jews. The Romans, who with all their greatness
  were an atrociously cruel people, employed it as the peculiar and
  appropriate punishment of delinquent slaves. Christ was "crucified under
  Pontius Pilate," the Roman Procurator of Judea, at a time when that
  country had become subject to the Romans, and its rulers could say, "It
  is not lawful for us to put any man to death."</p>

  <p>3. When H. N. refers to "the advocates of conversion and their
  itinerant agents," it is difficult to perceive exactly what he intends,
  except "to hint a fault and hesitate dislike." But before a writer
  undertakes to cast a reflection on those great societies who have been
  labouring&mdash;not by coercion, but by instruction and persuasion, by
  the circulation of the scriptures and the preaching of the
  Gospel&mdash;to substitute Christianity for idolatry among those who are
  under the government of Great Britain, he should well understand the
  grounds of his censures, so as to be able "to explain to the
  conversionists that, unless this doctrine be openly refuted, the
  missionaries may in truth be fighting their own shadow." <!-- Page 546
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page546"></a>{546}</span></p>

  <p>How then has H. N. explained the doctrine which they are to
  refute&mdash;the meaning of the "cross and basilica" in India? The only
  witness in proof of it has disappeared "by falling into a volcanic
  crater." He himself professes to be quite ignorant of cathedral
  architecture and the English government, and English gentlemen generally,
  who have shamefully secreted such a treasure, are equally ignorant. Why
  had they not consulted the living Church of Hindooism, and shown it a
  little sympathy and respect with a view to getting enlightened? Whereas
  "the little they do know is derived from books." Farther, "the elder
  civilians, men of ability, classical scholars, and first-rate Asiatic
  linguists," when assembled in that very building, though they descanted
  on the sanctity of the place, "not one of them knew nor remarked the
  'cross and basilica.'" And when visiting the great temple of Benares,
  H.&nbsp;N. does not recollect that the cross was either noticed to him or by
  him.</p>

  <p>It may be true that when the Hindoo "system of government existed in
  efficiency, there was neither crime nor punishment"&mdash;a shadowy
  tradition, I presume, of the state of innocence! It may also be true that
  "the mythology of the Nile agrees with that of the Ganges." But it would
  not follow that the cross is a myth derived from the mysteries of Egypt
  or the astronomy of India. It would still remain an unquestionable fact,
  that the cross, for ages an instrument of ignominious torture under Pagan
  Rome, only ceased to be so when Christianity had won its way through all
  ranks of society up to the imperial throne; then its employment was
  abolished by Constantine, partly from the humanising influence of the new
  faith, and partly out of reverence to Him who had suffered on it for the
  world's redemption.</p>

  <p>The anticipations of Christianity supplied by Paganism, of which
  Krishna "burnishing the head of the serpent" is a striking example, may
  be easily accounted for, and their source pointed out. As a corruption of
  the earliest revelation, Paganism contains, as might be expected, a
  portion of truth blended with much error. Indeed, it would be no
  difficult task to prove that classical and oriental mythology is in some
  sense, and to a great extent, the shadow of biblical truth. What then? In
  endeavouring to supplant idolatry in the Roman empire, were the Apostles
  and first preachers of Christianity merely "fighting their own shadow?"
  They recognised those truths which even heathens admit, but opposed and
  overthrew the accumulated errors of ages. Yet there were some even then
  who condemned the preaching of the cross as "foolishness," till success
  demonstrated its wisdom.</p>

  <p>Lastly, H. N., having "travelled much in this country and on the
  Continent," is convinced "that superstition prevails comparatively
  <i>less</i> in Asia than in Europe," and that "the pages of 'N. &amp; Q.'
  abundantly corroborate the opinion."</p>

  <p>This is far more startling than the discovery of the "cross and
  basilica" at Muttra. To admit it, however, would require us to disregard
  the testimony of a cloud of witnesses, and to ignore all our former
  reading. The vast systems of Asiatic superstition, it seems, are less
  objectionable than our own folk lore; the tremendous shades of Brahma and
  Budhu, of Juggernaut and the goddess Kali, with their uncouth images and
  horrid worship, are harmless when compared with Puck, the Pixies, and
  Robin Goodfellow; and Caste, Suttee, and Devil-worship<a
  name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> are evils of
  less magnitude than cairns, kist-vaens, and cromlechs. The mental balance
  must be peculiarly constructed that could lead to such a decision.
  Certainly H.&nbsp;N. is no Rhadamanthus. "Dat veniam corvis, vexat censure
  columbas."</p>

  <p>The appeal to "N. &amp; Q." in corroboration of his opinion forms a
  pleasant and suitable conclusion of the whole: for while in India
  superstition still undeniably lives and "prevails," it is one special
  object of "N. &amp; Q." to embalm the remains of local superstitions in
  Great Britain that have either breathed their last, or are <i>in
  extremis</i>; to collect the relics of long-departed superstitions that
  were once vigorous and rampant in our island, but are now in danger of
  being lost and forgotten. Their very remnants and vestiges have become so
  rare that they are unknown to the great mass of the community; and the
  learned, therefore, especially those versed in ethology, are urged to
  hunt them out wherever they exist in the different districts of the
  country, before they fall into utter oblivion.</p>

  <p>I would beg to suggest to H. N. that if his friend Count Venua saw in
  the Hindoo temple at Muttra both the form of a perfect cross and of a
  "basilica, carried out with more correctness of order and symmetry than
  in Italy," he must have been so totally ignorant of early architecture as
  to make his observations quite worthless, since there is no more
  similitude between the cruciform church and the basilica than there is
  between two parallel lines (=) and two lines crossing each other at right
  angles (+).</p>

  <p>"The precise shape of the cross on the Temple of Serapis" can only be
  inferred from the words of the historian cited, and the inference
  therefrom is strong that it was the <i>crux ansata</i>.</p>

<h3>DECORATIVE PAVEMENT TILES FROM CAEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 493.)</p>

  <p>The tiles presented, in 1786, to Mr. Charles Chadwick, of
  Mavesyn-Ridware, Staffordshire, are preserved in the church at that
  place. They form two tablets affixed to the wall in the remarkable
  sepulchral chapel arranged and decorated, at a great cost, by the
  directions of that gentleman towards the close of the last century, when
  the greater portion of the church was rebuilt. The north chapel, or
  aisle, containing the tombs of the Mavesyns and the Ridwares, the ancient
  lords of the estates which descended to Mr. Chadwick, was preserved; and
  here are to be seen two cross-legged effigies, a curious incised
  portraiture on an altar-tomb, representing Sir Robert Mavesyn, 1403, with
  other incised slabs and interesting memorials; to which were added, by
  Mr. Chadwick, a series of large incised figures, which surround the
  chapel. These last are not shown in the view given in Shaw's <i>History
  of Staffordshire</i>, vol. ii. p. 191., having been executed since the
  publication of that work; and it is stated that they were engraved by the
  parish clerk under Mr. Chadwick's direction, being intended to pourtray
  the successive lords of the place from the Norman times to the sixteenth
  century, each in the costume of his period. There are also numerous
  atchievements and other decorations attached to the walls; amongst these
  are the pavement tiles from Caen, one of which bore the same arms as are
  assigned to the family of Malvoisin-Rosny, and on that account probably
  Mr. Chadwick placed these relics from Normandy amongst the enrichments of
  his mausoleum.</p>

  <p>In regard to <span class="sc">Mr. Boase's</span> first inquiry, "Who
  was Charles Chadwick, Esq.?" it may suffice to cite the detailed account
  of the family given by Shaw, and the short notice of that gentleman which
  will be found in the <i>History of Staffordshire</i>, vol. ii. p.
  185.</p>

  <p>On a visit to Mavesyn-Ridware in 1839, I was struck with the
  appearance of these tiles; their design and fashion at once recalled
  those from Caen with which I had been familiar in Normandy. Having
  ascertained their origin, I took occasion to state the fact of their
  preservation at this church in the "Notes on Decorative Tiles,"
  communicated to Mr. Parker by me, and given in the fourth edition of his
  useful <i>Glossary of Architecture</i>, in 1845: see p. 367.</p>

  <p>It should be observed that the number of tiles composing the two
  tablets now to be seen is forty; whilst the number, as stated <i>Gent.
  Mag.</i>, vol. lix. part i. p. 211., and in a second letter from Mr.
  Barrett, in vol. lx. part ii. p. 710., not cited by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Boase</span> in his Query, is twenty. <span class="sc">Mr. Boase</span>
  is probably aware that the sixteen tiles from the Great Guard Chamber at
  Caen, which supplied the subject of Mr. J. Major Henniker's memoir, were
  presented by him to the Society of Antiquaries of London, and are now in

  <p>A coloured drawing of an heraldic pavement at Caen, taken about 1700,
  is preserved in a volume of the great collection formed by M. de
  Gaignieres, and bequeathed by Gough to the Bodleian Library. It comprises
  chiefly drawings of French sepulchral monuments, arranged by localities;
  and there is one volume, entitled <i>Recueil de Tapisseries, d'Armoiries
  et de Devises</i>, in which may be found the interesting memorial of this
  decorative pavement of tiles, which was destroyed during the fury of the
  Revolution.</p>

  <p>Charles Chadwick, Esq., of Healy Hall, Lancashire, and
  Mavesyn-Ridware, in the county of Stafford, to whom the monks of St.
  Stephen, at Caen, presented, in the year 1786, a series of encaustic
  tiles with heraldic devices taken from the floor of the (so called)
  "Great Guard Chamber of the Palace of the Dukes of Normandy," died in
  1829. I infer that the tiles were brought to the Lancashire residence of
  Mr. Chadwick because the description and the drawing for the engraving
  were both supplied to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> by a Lancashire
  antiquary, Thomas Barnett, of Hydes Cross, Manchester: but as the
  descendants of Mr. Chadwick no longer reside in Lancashire, the hall
  being occupied by a woollen manufacturer, I have been unable to obtain
  any information respecting the tiles, though long desirous to do so.</p>

  <p>I direct attention to another series of the same tiles, sixteen in
  number, which were presented to the Society of Antiquaries through the
  president, the Earl of Leicester, in 1788, by John Henniker, Esq., M.A.,
  F.R.S., S.A., and M.P., who afterwards took the additional name of Major.
  This gentleman received the tiles from his brother, Captain Henniker,
  then resident at Caen; and in 1794 he published an interesting account of
  them with engravings, entitled <i>Two Letters on the Origin, Antiquity,
  and History of Norman Tiles stained with Armorial Bearings</i> (London,
  John Bell, Strand). The engravings both in this volume and in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> are indifferently executed, and too small in
  scale to be of use. Mr. Henniker describes the colours of his tiles to be
  "yellow and brown," while Mr. Barnett states that the tiles in Mr.
  Chadwick's possession were "light grey and black;" a curious discrepancy,
  seeing that in all other respects they were exactly similar. These tiles
  are of so much heraldic and antiquarian interest that if either set could
  be made available for the purpose, it is very desirable that they be
  engraved of full size, and printed by the modern easy process to imitate
  the colours.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Simplicity of Calotype Process.</i>&mdash;The session of the
  Photographic Society was commenced with a paper from our original
  correspondent, <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, under the above
  title. Our journal having led to such facilities of question and answer,
  has induced many of our readers to ask upon several points additional
  instructions, some of which we have ourselves thought might have been
  made more clear and having written to <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>
  he has promised us a revised copy for our next Number. Replying to some
  of our Querists, he says, "The plain photographic facts are correct; but
  I wrote the paper on the morning of the day on which the Society met, and
  was not aware it was to be printed in the <i>Journal</i> until I received
  my copy."</p>

  <p><i>Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;As my only object writing on this
  subject was to communicate to others the plan which <i>I</i> had found
  <i>in practice</i> most successful, I think it necessary to correct some
  points of misapprehension which it is evident your correspondent K.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;M.
  has fallen into, Vol. viii., p. 501.</p>

  <p>In the process I recommended, the paper, if cockled up, readily
  becomes flat and even if kept in a portfolio or any similar receptacle;
  and as I <i>never float</i> my paper to sensitize it, I have not the
  inconvenience of the silver solution becoming spoiled by particles of the
  albumen. The 100 grains to the ounce for the solution I do not find more
  extravagant when applied, as I have indicated, with a glass rod, than one
  of 30 grains to the ounce when the paper is floated, because in the
  former case I use only just enough to cover the paper, viz. forty-five
  minims to a half-sheet of <!-- Page 549 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page549"></a>{549}</span>Canson's paper, and there is no loss from
  any portion adhering to the dishes, evaporation, or filtering. This is
  far more than would be imagined when only a sheet or two of paper is
  required at one time. Lastly, with regard to the <i>strokes</i> being
  visible after printing the positive, I do not find them so in general,
  though occasionally such a thing does happen when sufficient care has not
  been taken in the preparation; but I find striæ quite as visible on two
  positives prepared by <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> himself, which
  he kindly gave me: however, I will forward a sample of my paper for your
  judgment, and also a portion for K.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;M. if he will take the trouble of
  trying the same.</p>

  <p><i>New Developing Mixture.</i>&mdash;Having for some months past used
  the following developing mixture, and finding it very bright and easily
  applied, I beg to offer it to your notice. It does not cost more than
  three farthings per ounce, and therefore may be worth the consideration
  of beginners. I do not know a better where the metallic appearance is not
  desired.</p>

  <p><i>Queries on the Albumenized Process.</i>&mdash;Allow me to put a few
  questions through your valued paper.</p>

  <p>In the albumen process on glass, Messrs. Ross and Thomson, in
  Thornthwaite's <i>Guide</i>, recommend 10 drops of sat. solution of
  iodized potassa to each egg. Now is it meant <i>ten drops</i>, or <i>ten
  minims</i>? If the former, a drop varies with the bottle and quantity of
  liquid in it; and ten drops are nearly half the bulk of ten minims,
  generally speaking. Then as to the egg: an egg in this country is only at
  most 6 <a href="images/drachm.png"><img src="images/drachm.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="drachm" /></a>; in England an egg
  appears twice as large.&mdash;Could you state the general bulk of an egg
  in England, and to what quantity by bulk or weight of albumen the 10
  drops or minims are to be applied? When I say an egg is only 6 <a
  href="images/drachm.png"><img src="images/drachm.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="drachm" /></a>, I mean the white of one.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Poems in connection with Waterloo</i> (Vol. vii., p. 6.).&mdash;A
  correspondent of the <i>Naval and Military Gazette</i> of November 19,
  1853, signing himself "M.A., Pem. Coll., Oxford," has pointed out an
  error into which I had fallen "respecting the elm-trees at and connected
  with Waterloo."</p>

  <p>I certainly was given to understand, when I received the monody, that
  it was written by the public orator on the death of his son <i>who fell
  at Waterloo</i>: whereas it clearly appears by the obituary in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, that <i>Ensign William Crowe</i>, first
  battalion, 4th foot, <i>son of the public orator</i> at Oxford, <i>was
  killed at the attack</i> upon New Orleans Jan. 8, 1815.</p>

  <p>I hasten to acknowledge my mistake, though I am glad that the two
  copies of verses found place in your columns.</p>

  <p><i>Richard Oswald</i> (Vol. viii., p. 442.)&mdash;Your Querist will
  find many letters to and from him in Franklin's <i>Memoirs</i>. He was
  for some years a merchant in the city of London. In 1759 he purchased the
  estate of Auchincruive, in the county of Ayr, and died there in 1783. No
  memoir of him has ever been published. He was for many years an intimate
  friend of Lord Shelbourne, who sent him to Paris in 1782, and again in
  1783, to negotiate with Franklin, with whom he had been for some time
  acquainted. During the Seven Years' War he acted as commissary-general to
  the allied armies under the Duke of Brunswick, who said of him in the
  official despatches, that "England had sent him commissaries fit to be
  generals, and generals not fit to be commissaries."</p>

  <p><i>Grammont's Marriage</i> (Vol. viii., p. 461.).&mdash;In one of the
  notes to Grammont, originally, I believe, introduced by Sir W. Scott in
  his edition, but which appears at p. 415. of Bohn's reprint, we are told
  on the authority of the <i>Biographia Gallica</i>, vol. i. p. 202.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The famous Count Grammont was thought to be the original of <i>The
  Forced Marriage</i>. This nobleman, during his stay at the court of
  England, had made love to Miss Hamilton, but was coming away from France
  without bringing matters to a proper conclusion. The young lady's
  brothers pursued him, and came up with him near Dover, in order to
  exchange some pistol shot with him. They called out, 'Count Grammont,
  have you forgot nothing at London?' 'Excuse me,' answered the Court
  guessing their errand, 'I forgot to marry your sister; so lead on, and
  let us finish that affair.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My object in this communication is to supply an omission in <span
  class="sc">Mr. Steinman's</span> very interesting Notes, who does not
  show, as he might have done, how the letters of M. de Comminges prove the
  truth of this story. For, from the passage quoted by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Steinman</span> from the letter to the king, dated Dec. 20-24, 1663, it
  is evident that the count was about on that day to leave England "without
  bringing matters to a proper conclusion;" while that he married the lady
  within a day or <!-- Page 550 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page550"></a>{550}</span>two of that date may fairly be inferred
  from the announcement on Aug. 29-Sept. 8, 1664, that "Madame la Comtesse
  de Grammont accoucha hier au soir d'un fils." <span class="sc">Mr.
  Steinman's</span> omission was probably intentional; I have supplied it
  in the hope that the date and place of the marriage may now be
  ascertained, and for the purpose of expressing my hope that we shall soon
  be favoured by <span class="sc">Mr. Steinman's</span> return to this
  subject.</p>

  <p><i>Life</i> (Vol. vii., p. 429.).&mdash;Let me give A.&nbsp;C. the
  testimony of two poets and a philosopher in support of the "general
  feeling" about the renewal of life, which will surely bear down the
  authority of three writers mentioned by him.</p>

  <p>Cowper's notion may be gathered from the couplet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"So numerous are the follies that annoy</p>
      <p>The mind and heart of every sprightly boy."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Kirke White must have had a similar idea:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There are who think that childhood does not share</p>
      <p>With age the cup, the bitter cup, of care;</p>
      <p>Alas! they know not this unhappy truth,</p>
      <p>That every age and rank is born to ruth."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The next four lines may also be attentively considered. I quote from
  his "Childhood," one of his earliest productions by the way&mdash;but
  what production of his was not early?</p>

  <p>Still more decidedly, however, on the point speaks Cicero (<i>de
  Senectute</i>):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Si quis Deus mihi largiatur ut ea hâc ætate repuerescam, et in cunis
  vagiam, <i>valde recusem</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following passage is also at A.&nbsp;C.'s service, provided you can
  find space for it, and there are "no questions asked" as to its
  whereabouts:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have heard them say that our childhood's hours are the happiest
  time of our earthly race; and they speak with regret of their summer
  bowers, and the mirth they knew in the butterfly chase; and they sorrow
  to think that those days are past, when their young hearts bounded with
  lightsome glee, when, by none of the clouds of care o'ercast, the sun of
  their joy shone cheerily. But, oh! they surely forget that the boy may
  have grief of his own that strikes deep in his heart; that an angry
  frown, or a broken toy, may inflict for a time a cureless smart; and that
  little pain is as great to him as a weightier woe to an older mind. Aye!
  the harsh reproof, or unfavoured whim, may be sharp as a pang of a graver
  kind. Then, how dim-sighted and thoughtless are those, who would they
  were frolicsome children and free; they should rather rejoice to have
  fled from the woes that hung o'er them once so heavily. In misfortune's
  rude shocks the practised art of <i>the man</i> may perchance disclose
  relief; but <i>the child</i>, in his innocence of heart, will bow 'neath
  the stroke of a trifling grief."</p>

  was "exceedingly well done," I have before me another, printed in London
  for R. Gosling, 1715, with an engraved frontispiece, illustrative of the

  is, <i>The Mouse-Trap, a Poem done from the original Latin in Milton's

  </div>
  <p>Both translations are in blank verse, but that of the latter is very
  <i>blank</i> indeed, and possesses little in common with Milton's
  <i>style</i>, except the absence of rhyme. It thus begins:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The British mountaineer, who first uprear'd</p>

  <p><i>Berefellarii</i> (Vol. viii., p. 420.).&mdash;<span class="sc">M.
  Philarète Chasles</span> has misrepresented <span class="sc">John
  Jebb's</span> Query and conjecture about <i>berefellarii</i> (Vol. vii.,
  p. 207.). He never spoke of these officers as "<i>half ecclesiastics</i>
  (!), dirty, shabby, ill-washed attendants." They were priests of an
  inferior grade, answering to the minor canons of cathedrals, and superior
  to the vicars choral, who were also called <i>personæ</i> and <i>rectores
  chori</i>. He has far too great a respect for collegiate foundations to
  use such opprobrious terms when speaking of any class of ministers of
  divine service. The only conjecture <span class="sc">J. Jebb</span> made
  was, that the word might possibly have been a corruption (arising from
  incorrect writing) of <i>beneficiarii</i>, which is continually used
  abroad for the inferior clergy of collegiate churches, though not common
  in <!-- Page 551 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page551"></a>{551}</span>England. It is just <i>possible</i>,
  though not very probable, that this somewhat foreign word was misread,
  and gave rise to a blundering corruption conveying ludicrous ideas, the
  "turpe nomen" alluded to by the Archbishop of York tempore Ric. II. The
  conjectural derivation of the word from Anglo-Saxon words was not my own,
  but that of a subsequent correspondent. It is just one of those
  conjectures which, like that of "Mazarinæus," may be quite as likely to
  be false as true. I could suggest twenty that would be quite as likely;
  such as <i>bier-followers</i> (attenders on funerals, as did the clerks
  and inferior clergy in cathedrals), or <i>bury fellows</i> (query,
  burying fellows), or <i>beer fellows</i> (like the <i>beerers</i> in Dean
  Aldrich's famous catch), or <i>belly fillers</i>, &amp;c., or lastly,
  some corruption of <i>Beverly</i> itself. <i>Barefellows</i> is as likely
  as any. Still I cannot think that these functionaries were low or
  contemptible. Their position corresponded to a very honourable status in
  cathedral churches.</p>

  north of the peninsula of the Crimea, both being included in the Russian
  government of Taurida, and both countries were formerly inhabited by the
  Cimbri or Cimmerians. Malte-Brun says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The colonists are in many places ill provided with timber for
  building; they live under the ground, and the hillocks, which are so
  common in the country, and which served in ancient times for graves or
  monuments of the dead, are now converted into houses, the vaults are
  changed into roofs, and beneath them are subterranean excavations. Kurgan
  is the Tartar name for these tumuli; they are scattered throughout New
  Russia; they were raised at different times by the different people who
  ruled over that region. The Kurgans are not all of the same kind; some
  are not unlike the rude works of the early Hungarians, others are formed
  of large and thin stones, like the Scandinavian tombs. It is to be
  regretted that the different articles contained in them have been only of
  late years examined with care."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This does not establish the identity of the Argil and Kurgan, but I
  think it shows more particular information is likely to be met with on
  the subject. M. Malte-Brun, vol. vi. p. 152., in his description of
  Turkey, mentions a curious town on the hills of the Strandschea, a little
  to the west of Constantinople. It is called Indchiguis, and is inhabited
  by Troglodytes; its numerous dwellings are cut in solid rocks, stories
  are formed in the same manner, and many apartments that communicate with
  each other.</p>

  <p><i>Pronunciation of "Humble"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 393.).&mdash;I
  venture once more to trespass on your pages, in the hope of helping to
  settle the right pronunciation of <i>humble</i>. In the controversy
  respecting it, the derivation of the word should not be overlooked, as it
  is a most important point; for I consider that the improper use of the
  <i>h</i> has arisen from people not knowing from whence the word was
  taken. Now, as I am of opinion that it will go far to prove that the
  <i>h</i> should be silent in <i>humble</i>, by giving a list of the
  radical words in the English language in which that letter is silent, and
  their derivations, I beg to do so: premising that they are derived from
  the Celtic language, in which the <i>h</i> is not used in the same manner
  that it is in other languages:</p>

  <p><i>Heir</i>, from <i>oigeir</i>, i. e. the young man who succeeds to a
  property: the word is pronounced <i>air</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Honest</i>, from <i>oinnicteac</i>, i. e. just, liberal, generous,
  kind.</p>

  <p><i>Honour</i>, from <i>onoir</i>, i. e. praise, respect, worship.</p>

  <p><i>Hour</i>, from <i>uair</i>, pronounced <i>voir</i>, i. e. time
  present, a period of time, any time.</p>

  <p><i>Humble</i>, from <i>umal</i>, i. e. lowly, obedient,
  submissive.</p>

  <p><i>Humour.</i> The derivation of this word is obscure, but in the
  sense of <i>mirth</i> it may be derived from <i>uaim-mir</i>, i. e. loud
  mirth, gaiety.</p>

  <p>The compounds formed from these words have the <i>h</i> silent; and
  every other word beginning with <!-- Page 552 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page552"></a>{552}</span>that letter should have it fully sounded.
  Such being my practice, I cannot be accused of cultivating the <i>Heapian
  dialect</i>, which I hold to be equally abominable with the improper use
  of the letter <i>h</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Fras. Crossley.</span></p>

  <p>May not the following be the true solution of the question? All
  <i>existing</i> humility is either pride or hypocrisy; pride aspirates
  the <i>h</i>, hypocrisy suppresses it. I always aspirate.</p>

  <p><i>Continuation of Robertson</i> (Vol. viii., p. 515.).&mdash;The

  <p><i>Nostradamus</i> (Vol. vii., p. 174.).&mdash;My edition of
  <i>Nostradamus</i>, 1605 (described in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. iv., p. 140.),
  has the quotation in question; but the first line has "le sang du juste,"
  not "le sang du jusse."</p>

  <p>The ed. of 1605 is undoubtedly genuine. Besides the twelve centuries
  of prophecies, it contains 141 "Presages tirez de ceux faits par M.
  Nostradamus," and fifty-eight "Prédictions admirables pour les ans
  courans en ce Siècle, recueillies des mémoires de feu M. Nostradamus,"
  with a dedication to Henry IV. of France, "par Vincent Seve, de
  Beaucaire, 19 Mars, 1605."</p>

  <p><i>Quantity of Words</i> (Vol. viii., p. 386.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Anti-Barbarus</span> need not say we always pronounce Candace
  long, for I have never heard it otherwise than short. Labbe says it
  should be short, and classes it with short terminations in
  <i>&#x103;cus</i>; but I am not aware that there is any poetical
  authority for it. <i>Canace</i> and <i>canache</i> are both short in
  Ovid; all which may have helped to the inference for
  <i>Cand&#x103;ce</i>. Facciolati has an adjective <i>cand&#x103;cus</i>,
  to which I refer your correspondent.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. Hazel.</span></p>

  <p><i>"Man proposes, but God disposes"</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  411.).&mdash;This saying is older than the age of Thomas à Kempis, who
  was born about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1380. It probably
  originated in two passages of Holy Scripture, on one or both of which it
  may have been an ancient comment:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hominis est animam præparare, et Domini gubernare linguam." "Cor
  hominis disponit viam suam, sed Domini est dirigere gressus
  ejus."&mdash;Proverbs xvi. 1. 10.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The sentiment in both is the same, and their pith is given in a still
  more brief and condensed form in our own proverb. It is remarkable that
  while Dr. A. Clarke, in his notes on Proverbs xvi., has quoted it without
  reference to its authorship in the edition of Stanhope's version of <i>De
  Imitatione Christi</i>, which I happen to have, it is not to be found;
  but its place (according to your correspondent's reference) is occupied
  by the <i>two texts</i> above quoted. The work referred to is asserted by
  some to have been only translated or transcribed by à Kempis, and written
  by John Gerson, Chancellor of the University of Paris, a great
  theologian, who died in 1429. Be that as it may, I can assure your
  correspondent A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. that the saying in question <i>did not</i>
  originate with the author of that work. In Piers Ploughman's
  <i>Vision</i>, written <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1362, it is thus
  introduced:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And <i>Spiritus justitiæ</i></p>
      <p>Shall juggen, wol he nele he (<i>will he nil he!</i>)</p>
      <p>After the kynges counseil,</p>
      <p>And the comune like.</p>
      <p>And <i>Spiritus prudentiæ</i>,</p>
      <p>In many a point shall faille,</p>
      <p>Of that he weneth will falle,</p>
      <p>If his wit ne weere.</p>
      <p>Wenynge is no wysdom,</p>
      <p>Ne wys ymaginacion.</p>
      <p><i>Homo proponit, et Deus disponit</i>,</p>
      <p>And governeth alle good vertues."</p>
      <p class="i1">Vol. ii. p. 427., ll. 13984-95. Ed. London: W. Pickering, 1842.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the same way the author frequently introduces Latin texts from the
  Bible, and other books of authority and devotion. In the notes the editor
  generally refers to the place from whence the quotation is taken; but as
  there is no reference in connexion with the present passage, I infer that
  he was not aware of its source.</p>

  <p><i>Polarised Light</i> (Vol. viii., p. 409.).&mdash;I am unable to
  furnish H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. with knowledge from the fountain-head touching this
  phenomenon. On referring, however, to a little work, much valued in my
  boyish days, I find it thus mentioned:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The blue light of the sky is completely polarised at an angle of
  seventy-four degrees from the sun, in a plane passing through the sun's
  centre."&mdash;P. 219. <i>Newtonian Philosophy</i>, by Tom Telescope:
  Tegg, Lond. 1838.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The attempt to establish a <i>Surrey Archæological Society</i> has at
  length proved successful. Upwards of one hundred and seventy Members have
  already joined the Society. The Duke of Norfolk has accepted its
  Presidency, and the Earl of Ellesmere, the Bishop of Winchester, and Lord
  Viscount Downe, are among the number of its Vice-Presidents. The Society
  has good work before it, and we trust will set about it in a way to <!--
  Page 553 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page553"></a>{553}</span>secure the success which we wish it. The
  Honorary Secretary and Treasurer is George Bish Webb, Esq., of 46.
  Addison Road North, Notting Hill; from whom gentlemen desirous of
  enrolling themselves as Members may obtain copies of the Prospectus,
  Rules, &amp;c. of the Society.</p>

  <p>The mention of one county Society seems to call attention to another,
  namely, the <i>Somersetshire Archæological and Natural History
  Society</i>, the volume of whose Proceedings for 1852 is now before us,
  and affords satisfactory proof that the zeal and energy of its members,
  of which it numbers nearly five hundred, are by no means diminished. The
  papers and the illustrations of the volume are highly creditable to all
  concerned.</p>

  <p>The want of a collection of the early antiquities of this country has
  long been the greatest reproach which foreigners have been able to make
  against the British Museum. An opportunity of removing this has lately
  presented itself by an offer to the trustees of the well-known and
  probably unique collection, <i>The Faussett Museum</i>. Strange to say,
  that offer was declined: but, as a communication from the Society of
  Antiquaries strongly urging the propriety of a reconsideration of this
  decision&mdash;so that an opportunity which may never recur may not be
  lost&mdash;has been addressed to the trustees, we still hope that <i>the
  Faussett Museum</i> will yet fill the empty cases at Great Russell
  Street, and form, as it is well calculated to do, the nucleus of a
  national collection of our own national antiquities. We understand Mr.
  Wylie has most liberally offered to present his valuable Fairford
  Collections to the Museum, if the Faussett Collection is secured for
  it.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>The Life and Works of
  William Cowper</i>, by Robert Southey, Vol. I. This, the first volume of
  a new edition, which will be comprised in eight instead of fifteen
  volumes&mdash;cost twenty-eight instead of seventy-five shillings, and
  yet contain additional plates and matter,&mdash;is the new issue of
  Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i>.&mdash;<i>The Laws of Artistic Copyright
  and their Defects</i>, by D.&nbsp;R. Blaine, Esq. A little volume well
  calculated to instruct artists, sculptors, engravers, printsellers,
  &amp;c., so that they may clearly understand their rights, their remedies
  for the infringement of those rights, and the proper mode of transferring
  their property.&mdash;<i>The Attic Philosopher in Paris, being the
  Journal of a Happy Man</i>, forms No. LI. of Longman's <i>Traveller's
  Library</i>, and is a fit companion to the <i>Confessions of a Working
  Man</i>, by the same author, Emile Souvestre, published in the same
  series a few months since.&mdash;<i>Apuleius: Metamorphoses, or Golden
  Ass, and other Works.</i> A new translation, to which are added a
  metrical version of Cupid and Psyche, and Mrs. Tighe's Psyche, is the new
  volume of Bohn's <i>Classical Library</i>.&mdash;<i>Handbook to the
  Library of the British Museum, &amp;c.</i>, by Richard Sims. After the
  notice of this useful little volume taken by <span class="sc">Mr. Bolton
  Corney</span> in our last Number, we may content ourselves with
  expressing our hope that the trustees, whose desire it must be to
  facilitate in every way the use of the Museum library, will avail
  themselves of the earliest opportunity of marking their approval of this
  able attempt on the part of one of their officers&mdash;a junior though
  he be&mdash;to promote so important an object.</p>
